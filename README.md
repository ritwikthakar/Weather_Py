# Weather Py
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to make a few changes to take the plan my trip app to the next level. Specifically, we will be adding the weather description to the weather data which has already retrieved. Then, we will have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
